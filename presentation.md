# Digitally Presentation of 3D Heritage

How is our cultural heritage best presented in a digital 3D environment? From
the simple to the complex, everything is possible!

An [intial Open Street Map](/berlin) is one way. However this is absolutely not
submersive nor is there a clear story that is being told.

## 1. Simple model

{% include model.html mlid="7a97b5567a1d420ebda0d61634fa384a" %}

## 2. Simple model with 360ยบ Panorama

{% include model.html mlid="0ec35096975442188f5278665013bfae" %}

## 3. Scene with Annotations

{% include model.html mlid="7fe1e240b25347c2bcd120a583c72649" %}

## 4. Flythrough

{% include youtube.html ytid='anVb3x-QwIQ' %}

## 5. Flythrough with 360ยบ Panorama

{% include youtube.html ytid='z7UkefFngqE' %}

## 6. Interactive Streetview with Flythrough

Video coming soon.

A [demo tour](https://urban-photogrammetry.org/berlin/maptour) of Berlin is available [here](https://urban-photogrammetry.org/berlin/maptour). A feature of this tour are [share links](https://r.upo.sh/b8bwguUF) for sharing [specific](https://r.upo.sh/p4f2EBSs) [views](https://r.upo.sh/vVjwLIDW) of [models](https://r.upo.sh/pJQ3ar1B). But they also work for specific [locations](https://r.upo.sh/9FOl7KuE) on the [map](https://r.upo.sh/QGNGh1At).
