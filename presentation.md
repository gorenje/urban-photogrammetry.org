# Digitally Presentation of 3D Heritage

How is our cultural heritage best presented in a digital 3D environment? From
the simple to the complex, everything is possible!

An [intial Open Street Map](/berlin) is one way. However this is absolutely not
submersive nor is there a clear story that is being told.

## 1. Simple model

{% include model.html mlid="7a97b5567a1d420ebda0d61634fa384a" %}

## 2. Open Street Map with Pins

{% include image.html filename="osm-tour.png" link="/berlin" %}

An initial [Berlin Virtual Tour](/berlin) is a tour of Berlin in 3D models.

## 3. Simple model with 360ยบ Panorama

{% include model.html mlid="0ec35096975442188f5278665013bfae" %}

## 4. Scene with Annotations

{% include model.html mlid="7fe1e240b25347c2bcd120a583c72649" %}

## 5. Flythrough

{% include youtube.html ytid='anVb3x-QwIQ' %}

## 6. 360ยบ Panorama Flythrough

{% include youtube.html ytid='z7UkefFngqE' %}

## 7. Interactive Streetview

{% include image.html filename="cultural-tour.png" link="/berlin/maptour" %}

A [interactive cultural tour](https://urban-photogrammetry.org/berlin/maptour) of Berlin. A feature of this tour are [share links](https://r.upo.sh/b8bwguUF) for sharing [specific](https://r.upo.sh/p4f2EBSs) [views](https://r.upo.sh/vVjwLIDW) of [models](https://r.upo.sh/pJQ3ar1B). But they also work for specific [locations](https://r.upo.sh/9FOl7KuE) on the [map](https://r.upo.sh/QGNGh1At).
