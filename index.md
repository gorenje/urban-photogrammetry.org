# Urban Photogrammetry

This project is focused on creating a three dimensional documentation of our
ever changing urban environments.

Not only do 3D models provide a beautiful representation of environment around us today but they also provide future digital archaeology with a basis of knowledge.

Taking advantage of advances in [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) technology to provide a deeper perspectives than photos can. All 3D models a summation of many photos and thus can provide more details.

## Obscurity makes for Interest

There are many objects of interest but obscurity can be a good indicating of interest. There are some very beautiful gravestones and even though obscure, they can still be beautiful.

An initial [Berlin Virtual Tour](/berlin) is a tour of Berlin in 3D models. This is an active collection that is constantly being updated and will never be complete!
