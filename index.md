# Urban Photogrammetry

This project is focused on creating a three dimensional documentation of our
ever changing urban environments.

Not only do 3D models provide a beautiful representation of environment around us today but they also provide future digital archaeology with a basis of knowledge.

Taking advantage of advances in [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) technology to provide a deeper perspectives than photos can. All 3D models a summation of many photos and thus provide more details that pure images can.
